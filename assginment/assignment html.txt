Q.17: What is SVG
Ans: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a web-friendly vector file format. As opposed to pixel-based raster files like JPEGs,
        vector files store images via mathematical formulas based on points and lines on a grid. This means that vector files like 
        SVG can be significantly resized without losing any of their quality, which makes them ideal for logos and complex online graphics. 
               -   It’s not just their resizing abilities that make SVGs hugely popular with web designers. SVGs are written in XML code,
       meaning they store any text information as      literal text rather than shapes. This allows search engines like Google to read 
       SVG graphics for their keywords, which can potentially help a website move up in search rankings.
         -You can easily spot an SVG file by its .svg extension.
Q.18: What is difference between HTML and XHTML
Ans :- HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to create websites and web applications. Let’s break it down, so we understand the name better:

      -    Hypertext: Hypertext refers to the “text wrapped within a text.” It is very similar to hyperlinks and contains an underlying text that, when clicked, redirects to a new            webpage.
      -    Markup language: A markup language is not necessarily a programming language. Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document.             This leads to more interactive and dynamic text content.
          - XHTML
       -     XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
       -     XHTML is almost similar to HTML but it is stricter than HTML
       -     It is swift, accurate, easily maintained, convertible, and formatted
             All major browsers support XHTML
Q.19:What are logical and physical tags in HTML?

                               When we enclose the text in the strong tag, it tells the browser that enclosed text is more important than other texts.
 
        Physical tags : Physical tags are used to tell the browser how to display the text enclosed in the physical tag. 
                                 Some of the examples of physical tags are <b>,<big>, <i>.
